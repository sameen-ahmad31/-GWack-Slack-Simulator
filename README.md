# GWack Slack Simulator
I created a simulated platform called 'GW Slack' that facilitates smooth communication among multiple clients. This project involved developing graphical user interfaces (GUI) for both the client and server components. The clients could connect to the server, which hosted an interactive chat room known as the 'GWack channel.' The main goal was to mimic the functionalities and user experience of a real-time chat application, encouraging efficient collaboration among users.

By constructing this 'GW Slack' platform, users can engage in seamless communication within the chat room, just like they would on a real messaging application. The client and server GUIs were instrumental in establishing connections and facilitating the exchange of messages. The project aimed to provide a practical and efficient tool for users to collaborate effectively, fostering a sense of real-time interaction and enhancing their overall communication experience.I created a simulated platform called 'GW Slack' that facilitates smooth communication among multiple clients.
