# GWack Slack Simulator
I created a simulated platform called 'GW Slack' that facilitates smooth communication among multiple clients. This project involved developing graphical user interfaces (GUI) for both the client and server components. The clients could connect to the server, which hosted an interactive chat room known as the 'GWack channel.' The main goal was to mimic the functionalities and user experience of a real-time chat application, encouraging efficient collaboration among users.

By constructing this 'GW Slack' platform, users can engage in seamless communication within the chat room, just like they would on a real messaging application. The client and server GUIs were instrumental in establishing connections and facilitating the exchange of messages. The project aimed to provide a practical and efficient tool for users to collaborate effectively, fostering a sense of real-time interaction and enhancing their overall communication experience.I created a simulated platform called 'GW Slack' that facilitates smooth communication among multiple clients.

Regarding the Project's Requirements:
For the graphical user interface (GUI) aspect, I ensured that all necessary components were included, such as Name, IP Address, Port Number, Member List, Messages, and Composed Messages. Additionally, I incorporated buttons for connecting, disconnecting, and sending messages. To implement the functionality for receiving and displaying messages, I followed the lecture's guidance by adding the KeyListener and ActionListener methods. Using PrintWriter, I facilitated sending messages across the server. To ensure a proper handshake, I employed an if statement and try-catch blocks.
To maintain a modular structure, I created a separate Java file responsible for handling the client GUI, and the client GUI file itself calls the appropriate methods to render the GUI correctly. This design allows for smooth content switching during connections and disconnections. Moreover, I created a Server file that GWackChannel relies on, as per the instructions to test GWackClient and GWackChannel independently.
As an additional feature, I applied a black border to all elements and designed the GUI using various shades of pink. The top section features a light pink color, while the rest utilizes a combination of pink and gray. Furthermore, I integrated a JScrollPane to handle an overflow of messages and users on the screen, ensuring they are displayed properly without overlapping other GUI contents.
